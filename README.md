## Code Test scaffolding

âœ…As you take a ride ðŸš— through the Learnable Bank api, remember that For the `.populate()` method to work at your end, you have to make sure that _ids are pushed into the field(s) that is needed to be populated later.

âœ… The users(regular or admin) registration is through a form-data and not just the request body. The profileImages uploaded to the mongoDB is also available in the uploads folder.

âœ…As shown from the codebase, when using the PATCH request, the request body should be in an array of object. Example ` [{"propName":"transaction", "value":"deposit" }]`.

âœ…The response to all endpoints in the bank-Api includes a request response object with a GET request Link for easy Navigation
