âœ…As you take a ride ðŸš— through the Learnable Bank api, remember that For the .populate() method to work at your end, you have to make sure that _ids are pushed into the field(s) that is needed to be populated later.

âœ… The users(regular or admin) registration is through a form-data and not just the request body. The profileImages uploaded to the mongoDB is also available in the uploads folder.


These are the Api Endpoints for easy access 
âœ… User Registration and Login Endpoints

âœ…ADMIN
POST - users/signUp-admin
POST-users/login-admin

âœ…USERS
POST - users/signUp-users
POST - users/login-users

âœ…Accounts Endpoints
GET - admin/userAccounts
POST -admin/create-userAccount
PATCH - admin/disable/accountId
GET - admin/userAccounts/accountId
DELETE - admin/delete/accountId

âœ…Transaction Endpoints
GET - users/transactions
GET - users/transactions/userId
POST - users/transaction/deposit
POST -users/transaction/withdraw
POST - users/transaction/transfer
PATCH - admin/transaction/reverse/transactId


âœ…NOTE: Some Endpoints were added for ease of navigation through the Api. They were not particularly part of the demanded endpoints. These are:
GET - users/transactions/userId
GET - admin/userAccounts/accountId
GET - admin/userAccounts
